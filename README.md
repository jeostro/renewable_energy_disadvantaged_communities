# Community Solar and Disadvantaged Communities in NY, by Joanna Ostroot
Key question: Is there appropriate land near disadvantaged communities in NY that may be used for community solar?

# Summary

This analysis investigates the potential for solar energy production and benefits for disadvantaged communities (DACs) through the use of community solar in New York. The study investigates the potential for community solar use in or near designated DACs in NY. The study located and mapped appropriate vacant land parcels and DACs, finding areas of overlap. It identified parcels that were within DACs and parcels located near DACs, for potential use for community solar. At a policy level, the state government provides incentives and financing options for solar projects through programs such as NY-Sun. This may encourage investment in community solar particularly for DACs, which may have limited financial resources.
